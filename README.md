### Project Description
Pharmacy System was created for UofM Dearborn CIS 375 - Software Engineering Winter 2017. The goal of the project is to create a system for employees of a pharmaceutical company to be able to create prescriptions for customers, add and manage items in the company roster, and manage data to perform daily sales. Customer users can also access the system in order to view their purchase history and leave reviews for stores they have purchased from. The system also sports a *batch file processing* feature in which files can be read in to perform a large number of tasks, such as adding hundreds of items to the company database, or creating new store locations.

### Installation
1. `git clone` the repo.
2. Open the `PharmacySystem.sln` Visual Studio 2015 project file.
3. Ctrl + F5 to build and run the project.

### Usage
On the start of the program a user can create a new account or log into an existing account. In order to create a new employee account an existing employee must authorize with their credentials. The combination of `jon` & `testpass` for username and password can be used to verify creation of an employee account. 

Once logged in, type `help` to view a list of all available commands for a user.
